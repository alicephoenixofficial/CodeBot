### Code Bot Project Overview

#### **Vision**
To develop an AI assistant akin to J.A.R.V.I.S. from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, starting with Python-specific capabilities and expanding to support other programming languages and advanced planning functionalities.

### **Phase 1: Code Bot v1 Development**

#### **Goals**
- Build a robust Python-focused AI assistant capable of code generation, debugging, and explanation.
- Develop a modular, scalable architecture to support future iterations.

#### **Key Steps**
1. **Foundation Development:**
   - Finalize the Context Manager for persistent session tracking (local JSON storage).
   - Develop the Tokenization Engine for handling Python code and natural language.
   - Implement rule-based Intent Detection for basic intents.
   - Build a basic code parsing module using Python's `ast` module.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Scrape and preprocess official Python documentation to establish a foundation of core language features, built-in functions, and modules.
   - Curate and preprocess Python code snippets from open-source repositories, focusing on high-quality examples with permissive licenses.
   - Annotate examples with explanations.
   - Use predefined datasets:
     - `nltk.corpus.words`
     - `nltk.corpus.stopwords`
     - Punkt
     - Pygments
     - WordNet
     - The Brown Corpus
     - Friends Corpus
     - Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus.

3. **Prototype Development:**
   - Build a command-line chatbot interface integrating core modules.
   - Test with sample queries and refine based on feedback.

4. **Documentation and Testing:**
   - Write test cases for key features.
   - Document architecture and APIs for future iterations.

5. **User Feedback Mechanism:**
   - Develop a feedback logging system for ratings and comments.

6. **Plan for Scaling to v2:**
   - Identify machine learning opportunities for intent detection and semantic analysis.
   - Set up workflows for incorporating ML models.
   - Define milestones for advanced features like reasoning and task decomposition.

### **Phase 2: Code Bot v2 Expansion**

#### **Goals**
- Expand capabilities to include multiple programming languages.
- Transition to machine learning-based modules for intent detection and reasoning.

#### **Refined Data Strategy**
- Scrape and preprocess official documentation for each additional language to establish a foundational understanding of their respective core features, built-in functions, and modules.
- Collect well-documented code from repositories (GitHub, GitLab).
- Organize datasets into training, validation, and testing subsets.
- Ensure quality through manual reviews and iterative refinement.

#### **Hardware Considerations**
- Current development occurs on a 2016 MacBook Pro, focusing on efficiency and optimization within hardware constraints.

### **J.A.R.V.I.S. Protocol**

#### **Vision**
To enable advanced conceptualization and planning functionalities, supporting high-level tasks such as roadmap generation, feature brainstorming, and implementation planning.

#### **Roadmap**
1. **Modular Task-Specific Design:**
   - Expand Intent Classification to recognize planning-related intents.
   - Introduce a Planning Logic Engine for task decomposition.
   - Enhance Context Tracking for multi-session continuity.

2. **Curated Datasets:**
   - Gather examples of structured problem-solving and project management scenarios.
   - Use open-source resources and templates for planning-related tasks.

3. **Rule-Based Reasoning Framework:**
   - Define workflows for tasks like creating roadmaps and allocating resources.
   - Use decision trees or finite-state machines for guidance.

4. **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
   - Map relationships between concepts and tasks.
   - Dynamically generate and refine plans.

5. **Response Generation:**
   - Use template-based and algorithmic methods to generate structured outputs.

6. **Dialogue Management:**
   - Implement multi-turn conversation handling with prioritization of unresolved queries.

7. **Visualization Tools:**
   - Integrate tools for visual outputs (e.g., Gantt charts, flow diagrams).

8. **Iterative Development:**
   - Start with basic workflows, expand to complex multi-layered plans.
   - Incorporate user feedback for refinement.
